# GAME SPRITES

Game assets include:-
_ Enemy & Player Entities
_ Environment Tile Sets \* Gun & Projectile

Game sprites will be rendered on a level's screen,
so this can be literally anything.

The caveat is that the sprites should be in PNG format.

Organise your sprites in an order which gives you a
convenient experience.
